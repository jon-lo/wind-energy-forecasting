    "We used bootstrapping techniques to compare the mean wind speed of Forecast Category 1 to that of the other Forecast Categories, and repeated the process for Forecast Category 2, Forecast Category 3 and Forecast Category 4.  All statistics returned p-values of 0, such that we could reject the null hypothesis that the wind speeds of different forecast categories are equal.\n",

    "These preliminary inferential statistics on wind speed data from wind farm 1 indicate that wind speeds of different forecast categories are significantly different from each other. This is as we would expect. If the wind speeds of different forecast categories were the same, this would indicate that there is redundancy in forecasting, and this may be reason to spend less resources on forecasting."
