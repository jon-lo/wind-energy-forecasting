    "Comparing forecast categories to each other, it was found that Forecast Category 1 (1-12hrs ahead) tended to be significantly different from longer Forecast Categories (13-48hrs ahead), with 95% confidence. Z-scores for this comparison were in excess of 1.96 (95% confidence threshold) for all wind farms except Wind Farm 1, which had a Z-score of 1.798917, which still corresponds to 92.8% confidence.\n",

    "Another conclusion is that Z-scores seem to vary across all wind farms, with no apparent pattern. This may be due to geological features not accounted for in the data set."
